## How does it work?

When the program starts for the first time an account with **_Owner_** role is created. Shop owner can add products or mark them as unavailable. Visitors without accounts can browse through pages of products. Everyone with an account can add or remove items from their cart and later place an order. Users are able to check their own order history and the owner can check full order history.
